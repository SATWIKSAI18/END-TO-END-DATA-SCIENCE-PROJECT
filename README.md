**Task 3: End-to-End Data Science Project**

Implemented in: VS Code using Flask & HTML

In this task, I developed a full end-to-end data science project, which included:

1. Data Collection – Extracting data from an inbuilt library (Iris dataset).


2. Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.


3. Model Development – Training a machine learning model for predictions.


4. Web Application Development – Creating an interactive Flask-based web application with HTML front-end.




The final result is a fully functional web-based machine learning model, allowing users to input data and receive predictions through an intuitive web interface.
