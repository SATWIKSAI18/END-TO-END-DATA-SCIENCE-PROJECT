This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a data science application, from data collection and preprocessing to model development and deployment. The final deliverable is a fully functional API or web application, built using Flask or FastAPI, that allows users to interact with the trained model and make predictions in real time.

Overview
Data science projects typically go through multiple stages, including data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. This project follows a structured and scalable approach to implement each of these steps efficiently. The end goal is to develop a predictive model and deploy it as an API or web app that can be used in real-world applications.

Key Features
Complete Data Science Workflow: Covers all essential steps, from data collection to deployment.
Flexible Deployment: The model can be deployed as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI, or as a web app with a frontend interface.
Automated Data Processing: Includes data cleaning, missing value handling, feature engineering, and scaling.
Machine Learning Model: Uses popular frameworks like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model training and evaluation.
API Integration: The trained model is exposed via a RESTful API, making it accessible to external applications.
Visualization and Logging: Includes data insights, model performance metrics, and logging mechanisms for monitoring API requests.
Development Environment
This project is developed using Python and utilizes Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis. The API is built using Flask or FastAPI, making it lightweight and efficient for real-time predictions.

Tech Stack
Python (Primary Language)
Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (Model Training)
Flask / FastAPI (API Deployment)
